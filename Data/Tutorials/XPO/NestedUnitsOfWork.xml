				<description>Once the data navigator's 'Edit Record' button has been clicked, the modal form in which you can edit the current project is invoked. At this point the transaction is started. A persistent object which corresponds to the focused row is retrieved and passed to the modal form's constructor. It serves as a datasource for the editors displayed within the modal form.</description>
