			<description>The grid control is bound to the VirtualList object which implements the IBindingList interface. This interface provides the AddNew() and AddColumn() methods that allow a new record and column to be added. If dynamic row and column adding is allowed (the corresponding check editors are checked), these methods are called to add a new row or column each time a user focuses the last row or column, respectively. The FocusedRowChanged and FocusedColumnChanged events are handled for this purpose.</description>
